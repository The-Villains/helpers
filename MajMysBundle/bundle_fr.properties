trailer_01 = Hello. My name is Arturo, I am a journalist and detective. My specialities are ghosts and thieves.

trailer_02 = Every month I write in the spooky column 'The Ghosts are in', but the story I am about to tell you is for a different kind of readers indeed - the kind who want to take part in history.

trailer_03 = In 1902 the family of Louis Majorelle moved to a beautiful villa on the outskirt of Nancy. It was specially built for them in a middle of a vast garden. They occupied the house until 1912. When Jane Majorelle died and Jacques was touring Europe and even going on to explore North Africa, Louis Majorelle didn't have the heart to stay around the villa anymore. The house was occupied by different offices before being in the care of a museum curator, who carefully coordinated its restoration for years until the grand reopening of the Villa Majorelle Nancy to the public in 2020.

trailer_04 = I was invited to the event as were many of my journalisticly inclined colleagues. We rejoiced at the wonderful restoration, with the original furniture and decorative art pieces of the Majorelle family or very similar ones. It felt like the Majorelle family was still around... Actually, that wasn't far from the truth! As quickly after the reopening the Villa Majorelle closed again. There wasn't any explanation until one fine day I received this letter:

trailer_05 = Dear Arturo,\r\n\r\none of my museum colleagues gave me your name, saying you were a kind of spirit medium or something alike as well as a journalist and detective. I do not trust such fairytales to be perfectly honest with you, but most peculiar things happened in our Villa Majorelle during the last months of winter: objects were moving on their own, disappearing and reappearing... I am too much of a sceptic to truly believe in anything but my scientific understanding, but, as a matter of fact, I think that we may have ghosts! These ghosts can't be driven off - they are the Majorelle family trapped in their own home! They need to be pacified so we can reopen the Villa Majorelle to visitors.\r\n\r\nWe need your help! Please help!\r\n\r\nYours faithfully, \r\nThe Curator

trailer_06 = Hmm... Interesting... Everyone thought the Majorelle family was gone, but their souls still remain in this Art Nouveau Villa.\r\n\r\nBut why are they trapped?! Why do they haunt the Villa? Sometimes souls stay around because a matter has to be settled.

trailer_07 = This is a perfect case for me!

trailer_08 = The curator welcomed me the next evening with a tight-lipped smile, being not too comfortable with the situation at hand. I tried to reassure her, but as I went in, I could already feel something in the air - something moving really fast around me, jumping... It pushed me through the dining room and suddenly said to me: \r\n\r\nSir, I don't want to cause any unnecessary trouble, so either you get the matter sorted quickly - let's say in an hour - or you stay with the ghosts and this villa for... well, forever!

trailer_09 = Directly after saying that, the ghost turned around, left, and shut the door behind itself with the keys. I could hear it slam the front door and the garden gate shut as well.

trailer_10 = I was left behind, locked in the villa's grand dining room, with little time and no clue where to start. All alone - or so I thought.
